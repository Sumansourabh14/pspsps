Here's the information about this pet:

{"age": "0", "avatar": "", "birth_date": "Sat Mar 08 2025 00:23:41 GMT+0530", "gender": "male", "name": "", "species": "cat", "user_id": "83165680-d72c-49d7-9948-f3be82fb6c7a"}

If the pet has no name, suggest a few names (Give a JSON output for names)

How should I take care of this pet?

When to give him food, play with him, vet checkup, deworming, grooming, nail cutting, etc.?

Could you also list down any reminders that I need to setup to take utmost care of my pet? Based on this information:

{"type":["deworming","feeding_wet","feeding_dry","nail_cutting","litter_cleaning","vaccination","vet_checkup","playtime"],"frequency":["once","daily"],"start_date":"2025-03-07 15:49:00+00","end_date":"2025-03-12 15:49:00+00","time":"HH:MM:00","last_completed":null,"notes":"","is_active":true}

Please include the date and time. I know I can consult a vet but you can set reminders, later I can edit them.

For the reminders, generate a JSON with this schema (start_date and end_date is just for sample, you can write your own date values there). Write only one reminder JSON against one reminder type.

Note:
Currently I can only set reminders that will be activated only once during the day, so consider that.
If frequency is "daily", start_date and end_date must exist.

If frequency is "daily", start_date and end_date must exist and they both should be of type timestamptz.
Use the user_id and attach it to every reminder object that you create inside the JSON.
Use the id and attach it every reminder object that you create inside the JSON as pet_id.
